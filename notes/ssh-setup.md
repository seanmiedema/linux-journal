Finding the correct IP:
Used ip a to find the local IP of the Linux Mint system to connect to
On the other machine, used ssh-keygen -t ed25519 and  ssh-copy-id to move the security key to the Linux system
Had to resolve an issue where I had used the wrong IP to try to connect to and got confused when the other machine refused the connection
DOUBLE CHECK the connection info!
