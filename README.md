# Linux Foundations Journal

This project documents my foundational Linux and command-line learning as part of my DevOps upskilling journey. All work was completed on a Linux Mint laptop accessed remotely via SSH from macOS.

## 🔧 Skills Demonstrated

- Linux filesystem navigation
- Shell scripting
- File permissions (`chmod`)
- System information gathering (`uname`, `df`, `free`, `ip a`)
- SSH key-based authentication
- Remote system administration
- Git version control

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as my first hands-on DevOps project and forms the base for future automation, cloud, and containerization work.
